<p>In my videos have discussed how you shouldn’t be loading apps like <strong>WhatsApp</strong> or <strong>Facebook</strong> on your phone. What I’ll do here is explain to you why this is important. Because if you don’t, you will be sucked and it’s coming up next the popularity of <strong>WhatsApp</strong> seems to vary by country. With Europe and India leading the pack do these users think <strong>WhatsApp</strong> is private. The masses are gullible and in this video. I’ll explain the kind of dangers you exposed yourself to when you install <strong>WhatsApp</strong> on your phone apparently some large chunks of the world population aren’t even aware that <strong>WhatsApp **is a **Facebook</strong> property. And of course most people will not read the <strong>Facebook</strong> <em>End-User License Agreement</em> or <em>EU</em> la which clearly states a lot of the dangers.</p>

<p>I will be discussing here today people flock to <strong>WhatsApp</strong> because they hear the word encryption. And then assume that it is safe this is an amazing play of disinformation by <em>Zuckerberg</em>. Which he exploits to the fullest to highlight the issue here. I’ll illustrate this with an example of two people. Let’s say a man and a woman having a private and perhaps secretive affair, and both decide that they will use <strong>WhatsApp</strong> to converse. Send pics hoping they stay under the radar.</p>

<p>So we will investigate what <em>Zuck</em> would know about this relationship. First, when you <em>signup</em> to <em>*WhatsApp **, you use a phone number and it should be obvious that a phone number identifies you completely. Some here will think you can get away with burner phones and other similar options. You won’t. Next, most people who use **WhatsApp **will upload their *contact lists</em>. Those <em>contacts lists</em> we’ll have real names and phone numbers of people. And this draws not only a connection between a phone number in people’s names, but also what is called a <em>relationship map</em>.</p>

<p>Someone can infer connections based on intersections of contact list then <strong>WhatsApp **like **Facebook</strong> tracks unique identifiers on your phone such as the <em>MAC address</em> . Which is a unique serial number on your device that then matches your corresponding <strong>Facebook</strong> account. It will be the same identifier since it’s the same device your <strong>WhatsApp</strong> information is tied to <strong>Facebook</strong> in multiple ways. Your phone number which you use for two-factor authentication on <strong>Facebook</strong>, your MAC address your device fingerprint in general your <strong>IP address</strong> and your contact list.</p>

<p>Thus there is a 100% correlation between your identity on <strong>WhatsApp **and your real name on **Facebook</strong> . <strong>Facebook</strong> is a real name site. <em>*WhatsApp ** is not pseudo anonymous in any way. Meaning a *fake name</em> is meaningless.</p>

<p>So we’ll start with first conclusion that the main and woman having a liaison are now known by <em>real name</em>. It is also going to be known what times of day they are in touch with. And I would bet there would be a pattern. As well as frequency. I would also bet that if I were <strong>Zuck</strong> I could find these affairs just by comparing frequent contacts between a man or a women with different locations, different names and different contact list. This my friends is how made it data can be used for blackmail.</p>

<p>Now let’s go further. We already know that these people are not connected by virtue of having separate relatives, separate lives. With occasional intersections of location. Off-course <strong>Zuckbook</strong> will know your political beliefs, religious beliefs, financial status, friends work. Plenty of information here that could be used for blackmail.</p>

<p>It gets worse because of the device fingerprint. <strong>Zuckbook</strong> also knows most of the websites they visit. Every website or app that has a <strong>Facebook</strong> like button actually hosts a <strong>Facebook</strong> tracker that spots your device fingerprint. Then, the next time you log into <strong>Facebook</strong> or <strong>WhatsApp</strong> you can send a tracker to <strong>Facebook</strong>  and match your identity to what you have been doing on the <strong>internet</strong> even if you’re not logged in to <strong>Zuckbook</strong> .</p>

<p>Since most people are on <strong>Zuckbook</strong>, and people are posting pics to it all day. Then someone will eventually take your picture even if you’re in the background. And <strong>Zuckbook</strong> will be able to do <em>facial recognition</em> and tag you. <strong>Facebook</strong> <em>facial recognition</em> is at least <em>98</em> percent accurate. Probably the most accurate in the world. You will not escape.</p>

<p>So if you happen to be at a public restaurant having this <em>Lay’s</em> on, then, a table nearby could take your picture, <em>autotag</em> with location data, and now <em>Zuck</em> knows that you and your date are now seen together and recorded in <strong>ZuckBook</strong> in perpetuity.</p>

<p>Now, some will say that the conversations are encrypted and so we don’t really know what this man and this woman are talking about. This it’s <em>foolishness</em>. Intelligence agencies know that behavior can be revealed by the made of data, and it is not necessarily you know what’s being said. Intersections of locations at non-business locations and not at home already tell us a lot do these two people work together. The metadata will reveal that is there a pattern of hours to the conversations where there’s an absence of communications at certain times.</p>

<p>Let’s confuse the issue a little bit. Obviously, the information available to <strong>Zuckbook</strong> is incredible here. What if the man and woman were in politics, or some position of influence. Could someone uses knowledge to manipulate government in a way that could affect us in general ?. Control a vote for example. This kind of OPSEC or <em>operational security</em> analysis are doing here can be applied to other apps as well. For example, the same risk occur when using apps like <strong>Signal</strong> and <strong>Telegram</strong>.</p>

<p>Basically, any app that uses a <em>phone number</em> as the main identifier, and collects <em>contact lists</em>, are all dangerous. Some of you think that the answer is to never upload a contact list. The problem is that it is not you that’s the question. Can you stop your friends or relative from uploading a <em>contact list</em> that you’re in ?. <strong>Facebook</strong> or <strong>Zuckbook</strong> has its own very dangerous flaw. And that, it forces you to interact on the <strong>internet</strong> without <em>pseudo anonymity</em>,  yet without any sort of privacy.</p>

<p>It is very easy to retrieve information on <strong>Facebook</strong> about anyone. Even with the maximum so-called privacy settings. Watch my video about how they do that if you have any doubt. So I hope you realize that certain types of data or metadata are more important than you think.</p>

<p>The lesson to be learned here is that <em>pseudo anonymity</em> is extremely important, because, in effect, it creates this information. This is why I have my own <em>pseudo anonymous</em> app <strong>Brax.Me</strong>. There is no phone number requirement. There is no email requirement. There is no real name requirement. It is super encrypted on top of that and it is <em>open source</em>.</p>

<p>I made this app because I realized that the major major flaws in all these platforms can destroy your privacy. Even though they claim to have encryption. I hope I’ve given you food for thought and subscribe to my channel for more thought-provoking topics on privacy thank you for watching.</p>
